<h1>Poems by Lewis Carrol</h1>
</header>

<h2>Jabberwocky</h2>
  <div id="Stanza1">
    <ol>
      <li>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</li>
      <li>All mimsy were the borogoves,</li>
      <li>And the mome raths outgrabe.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

<div id="Stanza2">
  <ul>
    <li>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</li>
    <li>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</li>
    <li>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</li>
    <li>The frumious Bandersnatch!'</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Stanza3">
  <h3>
    He took his vorpal sword in hand:
    Long time the manxome foe he sought --
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
    And stood a while in thought.
  </h3>
</div>

<div id="Stanza4">
<p><em>And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!</em></p>
</div>

<img src="charmander.jpg" alt="charmander">

<div id="Stanza5">
  <ul>
    <li>One two! One two! And through and through</li>
    <li>The vorpal blade <em>went</em> snicker-snack!</li>
    <li>He left it dead, and with its head</li>
    <li>He went galumphing back.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Stanza6">
<p>
'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Stanza7">
  <ol>
    <li>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</li>
    <li>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</li>
    <li>All mimsy were the borogoves,</li>
    <li>And the mome raths outgrabe.</li>
  <ol>
</div>

<h4>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h4>

<div id="Stanza8">
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
</div>

<div id="Stanza9">
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done --
'It's very rude of him.' she said,
'To come and spoil the fun!'
</div>

<h5><div id="Stanza10">
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to fly.
</div></h5>

<img src="walrein.png" alt="walreing">

<div id="Stanza11">
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, 'it would be grand.'
</div>

<div id="Stanza12">
'If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
'That they could get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.
</div>

<div id="Stanza13">
'O Oysters, come and walk with us!
The Walrus did beseech.
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'
</div>

<div id="Stanza14">
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head --
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.
</div>

<div id="Stanza15">
  <section>
Out four young Oysters hurried up.
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
  </section>
</div>

<div id="Stanza16">
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
</div>

<div id="Stanza17">
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
<strong>Conveniently</strong> low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.
</div>

<div id="Stanza18">
'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'
</div>

<div id="Stanza19">
'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
</div>

<div id="Stanza20">
'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'
</div>

<div id="Stanza21">
'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'
</div>

<div id="Stanza22">
'It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'
</div>

<h5>
<div id="Stanza23">
'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'
</div>
</h5>

<div id="Stanza24">
'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:
'I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.
</div>

<h6>
<div id="Stanza25">
'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.
</div>
